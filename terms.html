          Please read these terms carefully before creating your account. By clicking "I Agree" below, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this agreement. You must agree to proceed — your data is important to us, and we are committed to handling it responsibly.

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>GreenLens is a sustainability analytics platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses understand and reduce their environmental impact. We operate as a research and analytical tool and do not provide regulated financial, legal, or environmental consulting services.</p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect your <strong>company name, email address, phone number, and username</strong>. These are stored locally in your browser's storage (localStorage) and are not transmitted to any external server. When you upload business expense data for analysis, that data is processed entirely within your browser — no file contents are ever sent to GreenLens servers.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Your account information is used solely to personalise your GreenLens experience — specifically, to save your past sustainability analyses so you can review your progress over time. We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or sale to third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>All account and analysis data is stored exclusively in your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This means your data never leaves your device. You should be aware that clearing your browser data will permanently delete your GreenLens account and history. We recommend keeping a personal record of your analyses. Because data is stored locally, GreenLens cannot recover lost account information.</p>

        <h2>5. Uploaded File Data</h2>
        <p>Any CSV files you upload for analysis are read and processed entirely within your browser using JavaScript. File contents are never uploaded to any server, shared with third parties, or persisted beyond your current session unless you have opted in to save an analysis to your History. Even in that case, only the computed analysis results (not the raw file data) are stored in localStorage.</p>

        <h2>6. Accuracy of Sustainability Estimates</h2>
        <p>GreenLens produces carbon emission estimates using publicly available conversion factors from sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the GHG Protocol. These estimates are approximations intended for internal planning purposes only. They do not constitute a formal carbon audit or regulatory compliance document. GreenLens makes no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any estimate produced.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The GreenLens platform, including its design, methodology, algorithms, and content, is the intellectual property of its creators. You are granted a limited, personal, non-transferable licence to use GreenLens for your own business sustainability planning. You may not copy, redistribute, or commercialise any part of the platform without written permission.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>GreenLens is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that results will be accurate for any specific business purpose. Use of GreenLens is at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, GreenLens and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the platform or reliance on any results it produces.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the platform. Continued use of GreenLens after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these terms or your data, please contact us through the GreenLens platform. We are committed to transparency and will respond to all reasonable privacy inquiries.</p>
